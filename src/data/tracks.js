        Good morning, sun — how are your skies above
        Gee, it's great to be alive and in love
        Good morning life
        Good morning birds, sing out your happy tune
        Feels so good because I'll be seeing her soon
               
        Last night she said she loved me
        What a pity to part
        I slept with both eyes open waiting for today to start
                
        Good morning life
        Good morning world — how are you happiness
        All at once I know what livin' can be
        It's life, it's free, it's someone waiting for me
        Who'll someday be my wife, good morning life
                
        Good morning life
        Good morning life
                
        Last night she said she loved me
        What a pity to part
        I slept with both eyes open waiting for today to start
                
        Good morning life
        Good morning world how are you happiness
        All at once I know what livin' can be
        Ah, it's life, it's free, it's someone waiting for me
        Who'll someday be my wife, good morning life`

        lyrics: `I am the hammer that looms, always prepared
        Coiled as a cobra concealed, a venomous glare
        My legacy is famine and death, a black storm of sin
        I lurk in the darkness of shadow, waiting within
        I shall attack with precision, a surgical strike
        Behold my war of attrition, a bullet to bite
        Seeds of discord were sown, this was my ploy
        Cesspool of culture we live in, I shall destroy
        I am the harsh truth of life waiting to strike
        The lesson never to be learned in every regret
        Within the darkness consumed my essence is hate
        An earthly vision of hell I shall create
        Amidst the vices and sin I manifest
        Time has honoured my evil, hope is bereft
        Madmen beheld my coming but no one believed
        Your ignorance was you undoing , you were deceived`

        lyrics: `My life, my life
        Makes me wanna run away
        There's no place to go
        No place to go
        All the confusion
        It's an illusion like a movie
        Got nowhere to go
        Nowhere to run and hide
        No matter how hard I try
        50 Cent:
        Yeah, 03, I went from back filthy to filthy rich
        Man, the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
        I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
        Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick
        Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
        'Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits
        I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
        If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned
        I'm doing what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
        Entrepeneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
        What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
        This is my recovery, my comeback, kid
        Adam:
        My life, my life
        Makes me wanna run away
        There's no place to go
        No place to go
        All the confusion
        It's an illusion like a movie
        Got nowhere to go
        Nowhere to run and hide
        No matter how hard I try
        Eminem:
        While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy
        I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete
        Sipping some of of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready
        To wolf down this spaghetti, or should I say this spaghett-even?
        I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
        Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginning
        He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offending
        He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
        Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity
        Now take the other end, dump them, then plug them, motherfuckers in each
        One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fucking see
        That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin' opinion to me
        I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
        Fuck letting up, you're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me
        Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah, it's happening again
        I'm thinking about the same
        Mother fuck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50!
        Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
        I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
        I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
        And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh oh, I guess it's bubble wrap
        This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
        Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
        Feels like I'm going psycho again
        And I might just blow my lid
        Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
        'Cause I'm running in circles with
        Adam:
        My life, my life
        Makes me wanna run away
        There's no place to go
        No place to go
        All the confusion
        It's an illusion like a movie
        Got nowhere to go
        Nowhere to run and hide
        No matter how hard I try
        50 Cent:
        I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid
        Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
        Maybe this is for me, maybe
        Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
        Maybe I'll do it 3 AM in the morning like Shady
        Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
        Tryna say the same classic, get your ass kicked mad quick
        Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy
        Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
        It's tragic, it's sad it's
        Never gonna end, now we number one again
        With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate
        Accept it, respect it
        This a gift, God-given, like the air in the lungs
        Of every fucking thing livin'
        Adam:
        My life, my life
        Makes me wanna run away
        There's no place to go
        No place to go
        All the confusion
        It's an illusion like a movie
        Got nowhere to go
        Nowhere to run and hide
        No matter how hard I try`
